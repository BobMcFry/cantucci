# Cantucci :bread: :bulb:

*Cantucci* is a fractal renderer written in Rust.
Or rather: it hopefully *will* be.
This project is very much **WIP**.
Come back later :honeybee: :blush:

### Planned features

This project is in its very beginning, so there are no concrete plans yet. 
However, we want to have two renderers: a traditional raytracer (rather raymarcher) and a real time rasterizer. 
The latter one works on a dynamically triangulated version of the fractal and will use OpenGL or Vulkan.

The user should be able to fly around with the camera (with the real time renderer) and render specific images with the raymarcher.

### Origin of the name

The most famous fractal is without doubt the [Mandelbrot set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set). Its name stems from its discoverer [Benoit Mandelbrot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benoit_Mandelbrot). "Mandelbrot" is a German word which literally translates to "almond bread" and refers to [this Italian pastry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biscotti) ... which is sometimes called "Cantucci".
